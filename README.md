# Java-Polynomial-Project
Java project created to perform operations on polynomials including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Polynomials are implemented as arrays and hashmaps in two distinct classes. 

Tests are done on the classes using JUnit. All classes are heavily documented with pre and post conditions for all methods.
